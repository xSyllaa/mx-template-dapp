## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
```typescript
// Categories (non-selectable)
interface BetCategory {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  isSelectable: false;
}

// Individual bet types (selectable)
interface BetTypeOption {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  isSelectable: true;
  legacyType?: BetType; // For backward compatibility
}
```

### Translation Keys
- Categories: `predictions.betCategories.{categoryId}`
- Category descriptions: `predictions.betCategories.{categoryId}Desc`
- Bet type names: `predictions.betTypes.{betTypeId}`
- Bet type descriptions: `predictions.betTypes.{betTypeId}Desc`

### Backward Compatibility
The system maintains backward compatibility with the existing `BetType` enum:
- `result` - Match result bets
- `over_under` - Over/under and goals markets
- `scorer` - Player scoring bets

4. **Advanced Filtering** - Filter by category, popularity, etc.
5. **Custom Bet Types** - Allow admins to create custom bet types
6. **Bet Type Templates** - Pre-configured options for common bet setups

## Migration Guide

### For Developers
1. The new system is fully backward compatible
2. Existing `bet_type` field still works
3. New `extended_bet_type` field provides enhanced information
4. All existing functionality remains unchanged

### For Database
Consider adding an `extended_bet_type` column to the predictions table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE predictions ADD COLUMN extended_bet_type TEXT;
```
